Do not use old pthread library in this assignment.

Implement sempahore functionality using only C++11 features. 

As discussed in class conditional variable is the easiest way of doing that.

test0
create and start 100 threads that with a random sleep timer. Use semaphore to limit the total number of running threads (currently 5)
another thread - watcher - will monitor the counter and print an error message if counter > 6

test1
create and start about 20-30 threads with predefined slep timers. Total sleep time is
23260 ms
so when running with 5 threads total time should be 
23260 ms / 5 = 4652 ms
since towards the end there will be less then 5 threads, the total run time will be more then 4.652s, 
I set timeout to 4.9s.
